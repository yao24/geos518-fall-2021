    "# Module 03: 1-D Diffusion Problem - Thawing Permafrost\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are going to apply what we've learned about 1-dimensional diffusive processes to developing a model of how climate warming will effect permafrost. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the equation for 1-dimensional heat diffusion into a soil,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho_s \\cdot C_s \\cdot \\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial z}\\left(k_s \\cdot \\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial z}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho_s$ (kg/m^3) is the bulk density of the soil, $C_s$ (J/(kg K)) is the heat capacity of the soil, $k_s$ (W/(m K)) is the thermal conductivity of the soil, $T_s$ is the temperature of the soil at some time $t$ and depth in the soil $z$. For the sake of simplicity, we're going to assume that the thermal conductivity is constant. This assumption is not strictly true, as $k_s$ changes with the amount and phase (frozen or liquid) of water in the soil. But it makes the math much simpler and is good starting point for a toy model. Under this assumption we can simplify the above equation to,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho_s \\cdot C_s \\cdot \\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial t} = k_s \\frac{\\partial T_s^2}{\\partial^2 z}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Going further, if we also assume that the bulk density ($\\rho_s$) and heat capacity ($C_s$) are constant, then we can combine them with the thermal conductivity and reduce them to a single parameter that is often referred to as the _thermal diffusivity_ ($D_s$) and has dimensions of m^2/s, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D_s = \\frac{k_s}{\\rho_s \\cdot C_s}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting into the above, we obtain the following governing equation that our model will solve, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial t} = D_s \\frac{\\partial T_s^2}{\\partial^2 z}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Applying a Numerical Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will apply the forward time, centered time (FTCS) solution developed in Slingerland and Kump, an explicit method. We will divide our soil column into layers of equal thickness, specify boundary conditions at the top and bottom of our soil, as well as an initial condition and simulate the evolution of soil temperature over a 10 year period. Skipping the math of applying this method and go right to the finite difference solution. Using this method, we can solve for the soil temperature at the $(i+1)$th time and $j$th layer in the soil,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_{s,j}^{i+1} = s T_{s,j-1}^i + (1 - 2s)T_{s,j}^{i} + s T_{s,j+1}^i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s$ combines the soil diffusivity, time step, and layer thickness as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s = D_s\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta z^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For our __top boundary condition__, we will assume sinusoidal forcing of air temperature at the surface, with a period of one year. We will then need to specify the mean annual temperature around which the surface air temperature fluctuates, and the amplitude of annual fluctuations. In this notebook we will use realistic, but synthetic, values for each. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our __bottom boundary condition__, we will assume a constant temperature at the mean annual air temperature specified above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our __initial condition__ will be a constant temperature (isothermal) at the mean annual air temperature. If interested you can copy this notebook and modify these values.\n",
